# Authentication

Authentication is **optional**. When enabled, Kula protects the dashboard and its JSON API
with username/password login, issuing secure session cookies. The health and Prometheus
endpoints are governed separately.

## Enabling auth

### 1. Generate a password hash

```bash
./kula hash-password
```

You'll be prompted for a password (input is masked with asterisks using terminal raw mode).
Kula prints a `password_hash` and `password_salt` computed with **Argon2id**.

The Argon2 parameters used are taken from the `web.auth.argon2` block of your config (defaults:
`time: 3`, `memory: 32768` KiB, `threads: 4` — double the OWASP minimum), so configure those
*before* generating the hash if you want non-default cost.

### 2. Add to config

```yaml
web:
  auth:
    enabled: true
    username: admin
    password_hash: "<paste hash>"
    password_salt: "<paste salt>"
    session_timeout: 24h
    argon2:
      time: 3
      memory: 32768
      threads: 4
```

### 3. Restart Kula

You'll now get a login screen before the dashboard loads.

## Multiple users

Add extra accounts under `users`. Each uses the same `argon2` parameters as the primary
account, but has its own hash and salt:

```yaml
web:
  auth:
    enabled: true
    username: admin
    password_hash: "..."
    password_salt: "..."
    users:
      - username: alice
        password_hash: "..."
        password_salt: "..."
      - username: bob
        password_hash: "..."
        password_salt: "..."
```

Generate each user's hash with `./kula hash-password`.

## How sessions work

- On successful login Kula issues a **random session token**. Only the token's **SHA-256
  hash** is stored on disk (`sessions.json`, mode `0600`); the plaintext token lives only in
  the cookie / `Authorization` header.
- Sessions are validated by **token expiry/validity only** — they are *not* bound to client
  IP or User-Agent, so they survive roaming and proxies.
- **Sliding expiration**: each successful request extends the session by `session_timeout`.
- A cleanup goroutine purges expired sessions every 5 minutes.

### Cookie flags

Session cookies are `HttpOnly` and `SameSite=Strict`. The `Secure` flag is set automatically
when the connection is TLS, or when `trust_proxy` is enabled and the proxy sends
`X-Forwarded-Proto: https`. (With `allowed_origins` configured for cross-origin access,
cookies switch to `SameSite=None; Secure`.)

## Bearer token API access

Authenticated API clients can send the session token in the `Authorization` header instead of
a cookie:

```
Authorization: Bearer <session-token>
```

## Brute-force protection

Login is rate-limited to **5 attempts per 5 minutes**, tracked **both per IP and per
username**. Exceeding the limit temporarily locks out further attempts.

> **Reverse proxy caution.** Behind a proxy, configure `trust_proxy` correctly. Kula uses the
> rightmost (most-trusted) IP in `X-Forwarded-For`. A misconfigured `trust_proxy` can let a
> client spoof its IP to evade the login limiter — `kula-scan`'s `BYPASS-XFF` check tests for
> exactly this. See [Reverse Proxy & TLS](13-reverse-proxy.md).

## CSRF protection

When auth is on, state-changing requests require a CSRF synchronizer token (sent in the
`X-CSRF-Token` header) and a matching `Origin`/`Referer`. The dashboard handles this
automatically. See the developer [Security Model](../dev/08-security.md) for details.
