# AI Assistant

Kula ships with an optional AI assistant powered by a **local** [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)
model. All inference runs on your own machine through the Ollama API — nothing is sent to any
external service.

## Requirements

- Ollama running locally (default `http://localhost:11434`).
- A model pulled into Ollama (e.g. `ollama pull gemma3:4b`).

## Enable it

```yaml
ollama:
  enabled: true
  url: "http://localhost:11434"   # must be a loopback address
  model: "gemma4:e4b"
  timeout: "300s"                 # max time to wait for a streaming response
```

> **Security:** the `url` is validated at config load time to allow only loopback addresses
> (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`). This prevents the assistant from being abused to make
> Kula issue requests to arbitrary internal hosts (SSRF).

When enabled, a 🤖 button appears in the dashboard header.

## Features

- **Multi-session conversations** — open independent chat threads and switch between them.
- **Per-chart analysis** — click the 🤖 icon on any chart card to open a session pre-loaded
  with that chart's recent data as CSV, so you can ask "what's causing this spike?"
- **Agentic tool calling** — the model can call a `get_metrics` tool to pull live metrics on
  demand (up to 5 tool-call rounds per turn).
- **Model selector** — switch between any locally-available Ollama model mid-session.
- **Draggable & resizable panel** — drag by the header, resize from the bottom-right grip.
- **Streaming responses** with markdown rendering.

## How requests are protected

Kula proxies to Ollama through a hardened endpoint (`/api/ollama/*`). The proxy:

- **Sanitizes prompts** — strips null bytes, trims whitespace, clamps length to 2000 runes.
- **Validates model names** against `^[A-Za-z0-9._:/-]{1,200}$` — rejecting shell
  metacharacters, spaces, and backticks.
- **Rate-limits** — 10 chat requests per IP per minute; 60 metadata (model list/context)
  requests per IP per minute.
- **Caps bodies & responses** — chat request body max 32 KB; Ollama response stream max 10 MB.
- **Limits the tool loop** — at most 5 `get_metrics` rounds per chat turn.

See the developer [Web Server & API](../dev/07-web-server-api.md) and
[Security Model](../dev/08-security.md) for the full picture.

## Picking a model

Smaller instruction-tuned models (3–8B) respond quickly and are usually sufficient for
interpreting metrics. Larger models give better analysis at the cost of latency — raise
`timeout` if a large model streams slowly.
