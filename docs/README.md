# Kula Documentation

**Kula** is a lightweight, self-contained Linux® server monitoring tool. It collects system
metrics every second by reading directly from `/proc` and `/sys`, stores them in a built-in
tiered ring-buffer storage engine, and serves them through a real-time web dashboard, a
terminal UI, and a Prometheus exporter — all from a single dependency-free binary.

> Zero dependencies. No external databases. Single binary. Just deploy and go.

This documentation is split into two tracks. If you want to **run and operate** Kula, start
with the User Guide. If you want to **understand, build, or contribute to** Kula, head to the
Developer Guide.
