# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in Kula! Contributions are welcome.

## Getting started

Per [`.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../.github/CONTRIBUTING.md):

> To contribute, open an issue or discussion on GitHub and share your idea.

Starting with an issue or discussion lets the maintainer give direction before you invest time —
especially for anything touching the storage codec, security, or the public API.

## The golden rules

From [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md):

1. **Build:** `./addons/build.sh`
2. **Test:** `./addons/check.sh` — runs `govulncheck`, `go vet`, `go test -v -race`, and
   `golangci-lint`, in that order. **All four must pass** before a change is mergeable.

## Workflow

1. Fork and branch off `main`.
2. Make your change. Match the surrounding code's style, naming, and comment density.
3. Add/adjust tests (see [Testing & QA](12-testing.md)). New parsers should get a fuzz target;
   security-relevant changes should be covered by both unit tests and, where applicable,
   [kula-scan](13-kula-scan.md).
4. Run `./addons/check.sh` until green.
5. If you touched Python helpers, run `black`, `pylint`, and `mypy --strict`.
6. Open a PR using the [template](../../.github/pull_request_template.md).

## Coding conventions

- **CGO-free.** The binary builds with `CGO_ENABLED=0`; don't introduce cgo dependencies.
- **Collectors return `nil` on failure** — never break the whole sample for one missing
  subsystem.
- **Storage codec is append-only and flag-gated.** Never insert a section between existing ones,
  never reuse a preamble flag bit. Follow [Adding a Metric Type](14-adding-metrics.md) exactly,
  and mirror any codec change in the Python decoder ([`inspect_tier.py`](../../addons/inspect_tier.py)).
- **Security defaults stay strict.** Don't loosen headers, CSRF, or sandbox rules by default;
  make relaxations opt-in via config.
- **Keep dependencies minimal.** Kula's value is being self-contained; weigh every new module.

## Where things live

See [Project Layout](02-project-layout.md). Common targets:

| You want to… | Edit |
|--------------|------|
| Add/adjust a metric | `internal/collector/` (+ codec, per [the guide](14-adding-metrics.md)) |
| Change the API or server | `internal/web/` |
| Change storage behavior | `internal/storage/` |
| Add a config option | `internal/config/config.go` + `config.example.yaml` |
| Change the dashboard | `internal/web/static/js/app/` |
| Add a translation | `internal/i18n/locales/` (see [i18n](11-i18n.md)) |
| Change the sandbox | `internal/sandbox/sandbox.go` |

## Documentation

When you change behavior, update the relevant page in this `docs/` tree and, if user-facing,
`config.example.yaml` and `README.md`. Operational deep-dives also live on the
[project wiki](https://github.com/c0m4r/kula/wiki).

## Governance & security

- **Code of Conduct:** [`.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](../../.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- **Security policy / vulnerability reporting:** [`SECURITY.md`](../../SECURITY.md) — report
  privately rather than opening a public issue.
- **License:** contributions are under the [GNU AGPLv3](../../LICENSE).

## Releasing

Maintainer flow is documented in [Packaging & Release](15-packaging.md).
